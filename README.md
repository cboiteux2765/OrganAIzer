## OrganAIzer

This project is a Gradio-based AI assistant that assists the user in cleaning their room by providing ideas. To build this project, I started with a Gradio Interface that takes an image input and integrated Moondream 2 to make the inference.

## Launch instructions

Fork the repository, then open a terminal instance and run "gradio app.py" for reload mode (when you make changes and want to see them real-time while running the application) or "python app.py" for the most current changes.

## Usage instructions
Upload an image of any kind, and Moondream will take roughly 1-2 minutes to make the inference. You can flag the response to save it for later.

## Limitations
It will error out if you remove the image and try to generate a response.
